                Journey from Khushali to babe...ahahaha🥰
                <br>
                Hey Buddy..from friendship to love we both know 9 months passed..but officially 4 months 🥺❤️❤️
                <br>
                Exactly on this day, before 4 months we both entered new era of trust, love, friendship, jealousy,
                respect,
                and care. I still really don't know how to express my 💯 of love to you... because even I can't define
                boundaries of my love..🥺🥺❤️
                <br>
                I still remember journey of our beginning of love. When our phone calls lasted for 1 hr. rather then 10
                mins. still incomplete talks..❤️❤️
                <br>
                When we both started sharine each and every details of our family without any hesitation.❤️❤️
                <br>
                When we started understanding each other and became support system in little things like exam, emotional
                imbalance, stress, and lot more..❤️❤️
            </div>

            <div class="card19-container card-container">
                When people noticed us that we are in relationship but fact was we are not..( uk what I mean 😅 )❤️❤️
                <br>
                But our love proved when our feelings took shape of tears which expresses that we both can't live
                without
                each other 🥺🥺❤️❤️
                <br>
                When you accepted your 25+ names except your real name from me..😅❤️❤️
                <br>
                When you scold me for not sleeping enough or not eating enough ❤️❤️
                <br>
                We loved each other baku when we understand each other's face expression ❤️❤️
                <br>
                Time difference between first hug and latest hug proves our love 🤗 ❤️

                <br>
                Every moment spend with you is always damn special for me. If I spend single second with you it makes me
                feel like lack of time and spending hours with you makes me feel very emotional we have to go back, I
                don't
                know when this missing you conversation will stop...and time will come when I'll able to come to you
                when
                you'll say you miss me... official love. Today 9:30-4 ..idk how this time ran so fast, but only thing ik
                is
                if not you then no one in my entire life. I never thought ke I can love and trust someone like
                endlessly. I
                don't know if I would able to express my 💯 love someday... b'coz every time I think about you..I never
                reach to my 💯 love. I love you is very few words of saying how much you meant to me. I am so much into
                you
                that .....idk what to say...but you are my 💯 .....bas one request....

                You are my strength and my weakness at the same time. My life has been complete with you by my side.
                Your
                love makes me a different person. I have felt things with you that I never thought I could feel before.
                This
                is precious and I don't want to lose this feeling ever. This love melts my heart and gives me

                The day we came closer, special connection felt which was never experienced before with anyone else.
                Slowly
                I started to mention you in my prayers. My goal remained same but I prayed to achieve that with you
                ✨❤️✨❤️✨
                <br>
                Then the time came when I felt that no other success is bigger then you....and you became the most
                important
                part of my life🥰🥰🤗🤗
                <br>

            <div class="card38-container card-container">
                I know I have hurt you number of times.... repeatedly even after promising many times I did many
                blunders by
                hurting you. Generally Trust rises after relationship but I might be the only fool in the universe that
                shakened your trust many times also made you questioned yourself about our surity...... I might be fool
                even
                for the fool ...I agree that I might have just 30-40% of checkpoints for what you are looking....But to
                be
                honest luckily I know how to change ourselves for the ones who are very very important for us....and
                without
                any doubt you are one of them. You are my only star in my sky that shows me correct direction at every
                moment of my life. You are the only chapter of my life for which I wish that never ends. You are not
                just my
                better half....you are more then that....Even the word "Everything" is also not sufficient to describe
                your
                importance to me. I'm not the perfect partner...but I want to be.....for you......only for you......You
                are
                my one of the decisions of my life on which I'm proud of.......and I also dreamt to be your proud. I
                might
                have plenty of unavoidable habbits...but I also have one good habit of acceptance ( whether you believe
                or
                not...but I think I have this quality for which I'm confident )...Last but not the least...for all those
                substandard mistakes...I am apologizing you from the bottom of my heart and I want you to trust me with
                the
                same mentality that you did before all those situations came.

                Niche di gai saari baatein kaalpnik hai...krupya iss se offend naa ho jaaie...yeh keval manoranjan ke
                liye
                likhi jaa rahi hai 😅
                <br>
                <br>
                Before relationship I thought that word "OKAY" means acceptance/agreement/information
                <br>
                But after relationship my thought goes hmmmm...
                <br>
                <br>
                This is what about your OKAY means sweetheart....😅❤️
                <br>
                I am confused whether your okay means okay when you're not okay b'coz your unexpected okay never felt
                okay
                as it does when you're okay so when your okay interprets differently my all okay senses just gets dimed
                and
                I pray not to hear this Okay that actually not means okay...I think your okay sometimes become special
                when
                actual meaning of okay is changed by saying the same word which can be only done by you my dear... 😅😘
                <br>
                <br>
                If you don't know let me tell you that what types of Okay power you have 😅..
                <br>
                Okay - the actual one..( general and normal )
                <br>
                Okay ( okiee ) - moody one
                <br>
                Okay - anger ( not expressed )
                <br>
                Okay - dramatic
                <br>
                Okay ho - when you face something unexpected but enjoyable
                <br>
                Okay ( ok ) - when you face both anger and upset at the same time...
                <br>
                In short you have more Okay's then I can imagine...and you know what... I'm still counting 😅❤️
                <br>
                And last but not the least... don't say me okay when you're not okay...is that okay ?...
                <br>
                PS: Just keep your brain aside and read....to understand above para 😜
                <br>
                Note: I'll enjoy all your Okay's... b'coz deep down I need them... b'coz it has your feel 🥺❤️
            </div>

            <div class="card43-container card-container">
                haha😂😂.....okay so not every okay is okay but each okay is somewhere the okay that has hope that
                everything will be okay ....so actually when I am okay I don't need to tell you but when i am not my
                okay
                will tell you that okay i am not so okay😂
